For this landing page, I tried to closely recreate the given design using only HTML and CSS Grid without using any frameworks or Flexbox. I divided the page into sections like the hero, NFT showcase, and footer while keeping the layout clean and responsive with media queries. The main challenge I faced was aligning the elements perfectly and handling responsiveness on smaller screens. Positioning the images, especially overlapping ones like the floating hand section, was also a bit tricky. Overall, the page works well, but there might be slight alignment issues on very small devices and minor animation delays depending on the browser.
